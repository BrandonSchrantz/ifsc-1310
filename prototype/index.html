                    <p>The student life at UA Little Rock is typical of public universities in the United States. 
                        It is characterized by student-run organizations and affiliation groups that support 
                        social, academic, athletic, and religious activities and interests. Some of the services 
                        offered by the UA Little Rock Office of Campus Life are intramural sports and fitness 
                        programs, diversity programs, leadership development, peer tutoring, student government 
                        association, student support programs including groups for non-traditional and 
                        first-generation students, a student-run newspaper, and fraternity and sorority life. 
                        The proximity of the UA Little Rock campus to downtown Little Rock enables students to 
                        take advantage of a wide array of recreational, entertainment, educational, internship, 
                        and employment opportunities that are not available anywhere else in Arkansas.<sup>[20]</sup></p>

                    <h4>Campus Living</h4>
                    <p>UA Little Rock provides a variety of on-campus living options for students ranging from 
                        traditional resident rooms to multiple-bedroom apartments. The university has four 
                        residence halls on the eastern side of the campus and the University Village Apartment 
                        Complex<sup>[21]</sup> on the southern side of campus. Six learning communities focusing on criminal 
                        justice, arts and culture, majors and careers, future business innovators, nursing 
                        careers, and STEM are available to students.</p>        
                    <h5>Athletics</h5>
                    <p>UA Little Rock's <em>14</em> athletic teams are known as the Little Rock Trojans, with almost all 
                        teams participating in the Sun Belt Conference. Little Rock is one of two Sun Belt 
                        members that <strong>do not sponsor</strong> football (UT Arlington being the other); UA Little Rock last 
                        fielded a football team in 1955 when it was known as Little Rock Junior College. Little 
                        Rock's main athletic offices are located in the Jack Stephens Center. UA Little Rock 
                        offers the following sports:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Baseball</strong></li>
                        <li>Men's and Women's <strong>Basketball</strong></li>
                        <li>Men's and Women's <strong>Golf</strong></li>
                        <li>Women's <strong>Volleyball</strong></li>

                        <li>Men's <strong>wrestling</strong></li>
                    </ol>
                    <blockquote>Two Little Rock teams that <strong>do not compete</strong> in the Sun Belt are the women's swimming and 
                        diving team (<em>Missouri Valley Conference</em>) and wrestling (<em>Pac-12 Conference</em>), neither of 
                        which the Sun Belt sponsors. Wrestling is the school's newest sport, starting in 2019, 
                        and is the first Division I program in Arkansas.</blockquote>
                    <p><em>Little Rock will move to the Ohio Valley Conference for the 2022-23 season.</em></p>
