                <p>What a wonder the reaches of space are. Exspecially the red planet, Mars. Many people have 
                    often wondered what sights that planet has to present, but for the longest time, our eyes 
                    could only get as close to it through a telescopic lense. But curiosity of this world, one 
                    more similar to Earth than any other planet in the solar system, would not be stymied by a 
                    little distance of 140 million miles. So we launched unmanned rovers, and they actually made 
                    there! But what did these rovers find and discoveries they make? What technologies did they 
                    employ? And what exactly was their target objective?</p>
