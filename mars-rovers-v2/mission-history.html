                    <h1>Mission History of Curiosity and Perseverance</h1>
                </header>
                <p>The NASA Mars rovers "Curiosity" and "Perseverance" are the only two NASA rovers currently active on Mars and continuing the ongoing search for knowledge. This fact is certainly memorialized in thier very names. Curiosity is after all, what drives mankind to reach for the stars. It is a simple drive to learn more. But obtaining knowledge is not without a great deal of Perseverance. Perseverance that has withstanded decades of hard trial and error.</p>

                <h4>Accomplishments</h4>
                <h5>Curiosity</h5>
                <p>It didn't take long for Curiosity to make its first big discovery. Located in the Gale Crater, there existed mineral and chemical evidence that of a habitable environment. The Gale Crater was at one point apairently home to shallow rivers and lakes. Also, found in Yellowknife Bay, were elements that are necessary for life, giving rise to further possibilities. Additionally discoveries of organic compounds, atmospheric methane, and a deduction of radiation amounts were made. Curiosity continues its ongoing mission.</p>
                <h5>Perseverance</h5>
                <p>Various discoveries related to the volcanic, habitabilty, presence of water, and history have been made by Perseverance as it relates to its landing location in the Jezero Crater. Firstly volcanic rocks were found. This discover occured within one year of its mission. Also found were anciemt lakebeds, which were sampled. The role of water on Mars has been made clearer. Perseverance also managed to turn carbon-dioxide into oxygen. Lastly, sound was recorded.</p>
