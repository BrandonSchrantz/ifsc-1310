    <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    <p>Progressive enhancement, simply put, is a mindset of web developement that focuses on the content
      of a webpage. That is to say, no matter what browser a user may be equipped with, a web developer
      builds their site with the intention that it is universally accessable. That is not to say that a web
      developer can't make use of newer features, but those features will simply act as the cherry on top
      to what is already easily accessable to all users of as many browsers as possible. The takaway from all
      this? Content is the focus, and content is what any user can absorb, no matter how the developer intended to 
      present it. Looking at the web today, this has become a very important aspect. There are dozens of browsers
      out there, and the expectation to customize every page to every nuance of every browser us unrealistic. However,
      with progressive enhancement, at the very least, each browser can display the big picture of a web page.

    <h2>Feedback Writing Assignment</h2>
    <p>The first thing that become acutely aware to me when working on this project was the difficulty writing
      the css soon after starting the project. It took me three attempts to settle on an acceptable markup for
      the first draft. But I was suprised to notice a real progressive feeling of learning from each attempt. The
      final attempt was considerably more refined than the first, and I had a better understanding on how to make
      use of html classes and IDs. Doing individual excersices were relatively easy to comprehend, but the project 
      is definitely an eye opener in how to use our newly aquired toolkit. But that only came with trial and error. 
    </p>
    <p>Working on the second draft, I'm noticing various obtimal changes to make to the css, such as removing fixed
      units of measurements in places where responsive units would be preferred. From the feedback I have received
      from peers, it mostly concerned minute changes to text content. For instance, one had confused a tab in the 
      navigation bar for an about page labeled "Mission", as in "mission-statement." I've since renamed and clarified
      it as "Mission History". Another said captions would help them better understand the images displayed. I agreed 
      since the purpose of some of them on reflection do look arbitrarly placed, rather than with purpose.
